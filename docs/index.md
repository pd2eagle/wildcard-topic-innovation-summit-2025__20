**One sentence on impact:** In three days we surface wildcard ideas from across the Innovation Summit and translate them into prototypes, visuals, and next-step pilots that decision makers can act on.

> **About this site:** This is a public, in-progress record of Innovation Summit Team 20. Update anything here in your browser: open a file → pencil icon → Commit changes. The page is structured so we can talk through the project in under two minutes.

## How to use this page (for the team)
- **Edit this file:** `docs/index.md` → ✎ → change text → **Commit changes**.
- **Add images:** upload to `docs/assets/` and reference like `assets/your_file.png`.
- Keep **text short** and **visuals first**. Think “storyboard captions,” not full reports.

---

## Day 1 — Define & Explore
### Our product 📣
- A dashboard/interactive search tool to more easily comb through 2,400 Environmental Impact Statement/Assessment documents from the US Forest Service.

### Our question(s) 📣
- How can we create a tool for non-technical tribal decision-makers to access and understand meaningful information about extractive activities in the HeSapa through EIAs?


### Hypotheses / intentions


### Why this matters (the “upshot”) 📣
- HeSapa is sacred to multiple tribes
- The information will be accessible to non-technical audiences
- Supports corporate accountability & transparency; environmental justice; and treaty rights around extractive activities in the HeSapa



### Inspirations (papers, datasets, tools)

### Field notes / visuals

*Caption: Mapping questions from the first round of ideation to identify gaps in our wildcard atlas.*

> **Different perspectives:** We debated whether to focus on one flagship prototype or map the broader landscape. The atlas approach won because it keeps doors open for other teams to plug in.

---

## Day 2 — Data & Methods
*Focus: ingest submissions, prototype clustering + scoring, ship a first visual.*

### Data sources we’re exploring 📣
- **CyVerse form exports (CSV)** — structured responses from the summit intake form with text summaries, stage, and contact info.

  ![First look at wildcard clustering output](assets/explore_data_plot.png)
[Raw photo location: explore_data_plot.png](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/wildcard-topic-innovation-summit-2025__20/blob/main/docs/assets/explore_data_plot.png)
  *Snapshot: BERTopic clusters highlighting recurring needs around monitoring, storytelling, and rapid response.*

- **Facilitator note uploads (Markdown)** — qualitative summaries from each session (internal link in community folder).
- **Lightning talk slides (PDF)** — quick cues for visuals to include in the atlas.

### Methods / technologies we’re testing 📣
- Semantic embedding of idea descriptions with SentenceTransformers + BERTopic.
- Lightweight scoring model that blends facilitator rankings with novelty heuristics.
- Observable-style prototype for the “Wildcard Atlas” landing page (embedded via iframe screenshot for now).

### Challenges identified
- Not all submissions include clear geographic or beneficiary info, making scoring harder.
- Slides are graphics-heavy; extracting text for clustering requires extra preprocessing.
- Coordinating permissions for idea owners before publishing summaries.

### Visuals

## Final Share Out — Insights & Sharing
*Focus: synthesize signals, highlight the top wildcard prototypes, outline hand-offs.*

[Raw photo location: team_photo.jpg](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/wildcard-topic-innovation-summit-2025__20/blob/main/docs/assets/team_photo.jpg)

### Findings at a glance 📣
- **Three clusters account for 60% of wildcard excitement:** community sensing, generative storytelling, and rapid mutual-aid logistics.
- **Low-effort data packaging unlocks action:** publishing CSV + thumbnails let three partner teams request follow-up conversations immediately.
- **Summit alumni want a shared backlog:** half of survey respondents volunteered to champion at least one wildcard if we keep the atlas updated.

### Visuals that tell the story 📣

### What’s next? 📣
- Finalize two-page atlas brief and share with summit organizers + CU leadership.
- Host a 45-minute virtual ideation to assign owners for the top three wildcard prototypes.
- Coordinate with CyVerse staff to pilot a persistent “Wildcard backlog” workspace for the 2025 cohort.
